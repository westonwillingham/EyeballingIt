This was my final capstone project for the Galvanize Data Science Immersive bootcamp that I completed last year.  

I never cleaned up this code after the course fininshed because I immediately began working at SpaceX.

In this project, I used transfer learning to train a pretrained NLP model to learn my voice and my accent. 

My attempt was to build a neural network that encoded visual context from a presentation to Bayesianly update the probabilities of a word appearing on a creen... for example, Euler would be interpreted as "oiler" in a math lecture. 

I did not solve that problem, but I created this NLP model to be build onto later down the line.  

The code is a mess because I didn't learn how to cleanly build code before I did this bootcamp! My more recent projects reflect that I know how to code properly. 

Feel free to reach out for me for an explanation of this project!
